@app.route("/similarity/queries", methods=["POST"]) : 
# This endpoint generates vectors for given search queries based on the selected embedding model and return the similarity result of the given queries(QPPs)
@app.route("/similarity/query/abstracts", methods=["POST"]) : 
# This endpoint generates vectors for given search queries and abstracts based on the selected embedding model and return the similarity result of the given inputs (QPPs)
@app.route("/similarity/query/abstracts", methods=["POST"]) :
# This endpoint generates vectors for given relevant asbtracts and retrievd abstracts based on the selected embedding model and return the similarity result of the given inputs(QPPs)
@app.route("/import/abstracts", methods=["POST"])
